<div class="text">
<h3 id="why-everyone-hates-recruiters">Why everyone hates
recruiters</h3>
<p>Because they’re speedboat-salesmen-hybrid-secret-police masquerading
as humanists.</p>
</div>


<div class="text">
<p>HR should not be about policing - but about keeping talent happy and
fulfilled.</p>
</div>


<div class="text">
<p>Moral posturing is out, saying what you mean is in.</p>
</div>


<div class="text">
<h3 id="linkedin-is-dead-but-doesnt-deserve-a-funeral">Linkedin is dead
but doesn’t deserve a funeral</h2>
<p>Like Facebook it will soon be a boomer wasteland.</p>
</div>


<div class="text">
<h3 id="why-the-outlier-is-your-friend">Why the outlier is your
friend</h3>
<p>Because an identified outlier is not tricking you into thinking they’re
something they’re not. People who come across as exactly what you think
you want, are merely skilled at coming across as exactly what they sense
you think you want.</p>
</div>


<div class="text">
<h3 id="nervous-candidates-that-undersell">Nervous candidates that
undersell</h2>
<p>See <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger
effect</a>.</p>
</div>


<div class="text">
<h3 id="experience-vs.-ability-to-learn">Experience vs. ability to
learn</h2>
<p>Oftentiems the better candidate may not have all the skills you want
right now, but in the long term it’s better to have someone who is
constantly learning than someone who believes they know enough.</p>
</div>


<div class="text">
<h3 id="a-better-approach-to-personality-matrixes">A better approach to
personality matrixes</h2>
<p>It’s not quantization that’s at fault, it’s the lack of psychological
acumen in the first place.</p>
</div>


<div class="text">
<p>Corporate culture, like any other culture, is defined by the people
who participate in it - those who <em>embody it</em>. Startups can throw
around words like “collaboration”, “autonomy”, and “respect” as much as
they like, but typically the companies that have the healthiest culture
<em>define it the least</em>.</p>
<p>Why? Because they’re too busy embodying it. Moral posturing is on
it’s way out - increasingly these postures are the mark of a business
with no product, no future.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with recruiting? Hiring decisions are the
most important decisions.</p>
</div>


<div class="text">
<p>Candidates read about “cultures of respect” on your website only to
be initiated by being jerked around for a month by a recruiter. Once
hired, they’ve been taught what the culture really is - dicking each
other around and getting away with it.</p>
</div>


<div class="text">
<p>People get into recruiting because they love the imbalance of power,
but they never use it as the tool that it is. The power dynamic can be
useful in discovering who someone is - they do their dance, try this or
that, and eventually reveal themselves. Most recruiters are too caught
up in the power trip to accomplish anything useful to anyone but
themselves.</p>
</div>


<div class="text">
<h3 id="recruiters-need-self-knowledge">Recruiters need self
knowledge</h3>
<p>Because too often their own transferences and resonances with a
candidate make them like or dislike them for reasons totally unrelated
to the question “Will this candidate <em>do the job?</em>”. Unless you
are familiar with yourself, your motivations, your feelings and past,
you are unqualified to make an analytical and intuitive interpretation
of a stranger based on a 30 minute video call.</p>
</div>


<div class="text">
<p>Often when recruiters ask about challenges and conflicts at previous
workplaces, it seems to preemptively blame the candidate for the
situation and saddle them with its resolution. When attempting to learn
about the negative aspects of work history, it’s better to frame it as
an opportunity to learn about what that person finds unacceptable.</p>
<p>Experienced personnel are often very opinionated about
professionalism, and the clear expression of dislikes should not be
discouraged under the guise of “playing nice”.</p>
</div>


<div class="text">
<p>Recruiters make the mistake of forging ahead through every interview
as if they’re identical, and not changing their course of questioning
depending on the answer of the applicant and the overall tone of the
interview. In other words, without anything receptive or unexpected
you’re never going to draw the best out of desireable applicants, nor
draw the worst out of the applicants you don’t want.</p>
</div>


<div class="text">
<p>Anyone can come up with a limited script of questions to fire out
robotically at a candidate. However, plowing through regardless of
response and emotional tone creates no rapport and nothing is
learned.</p>
<p>A recruiter has to be receptive, monitor their own feelings, and
forego expectations in order to encourage novelty and actual
communication. They need to learn to bring out the best in a desireable
applicant, and bring out the worst in those who should not proceed.</p>
</div>



<div class="text">
<h3 id="why-employment-gaps-shouldnt-matter">Why employment gaps
shouldn’t matter</h2>
<p>Employment gaps often indicate personal development. Many people use
employment as an avoidance strategy and end up being emotionally
stunted.</p>
</div>


<div class="text">
<p>Never skip reviewing materials provided by the candidate before the
preliminary interview - resume, cover letter, website, work samples. Not
only does this disrespect the effort represented by these items, but it
wastes their time by forcing them to tell you what you should already
know. Anyone worth hiring hates wasting their time.</p>
</div>


<div class="text">
<p>Reveal your damn interview process.</p>
</div>


<div class="text">
<h3 id="the-recursive-hell-of-references">The recursive hell of
references</h3>
<p>You already know the candidate. Are you going to get references for
your references?</p>
</div>


<div class="text">
<p>Having a job history isn’t about having a perfect past, it’s about
having a diverse past and learning from it.</p>
</div>


<div class="text">
<p>Candidates should be explicitly asked to tell the whole truth, which
won’t work unless you’ve established that you’re someone they can trust.
That requires demonstrating the willingness to take the risk of telling
the truth.</p>
