Moral posturing is out, saying what you mean is in.

---

HR should not be about policing - but about keeping talent happy and fulfilled.

---

Reveal your damn interview process.

---

### Why the outlier is your friend

Because you know they're not tricking you into thinking they're something they're not. People who come across as exactly what you think you want, are merely skilled at coming across as exactly what they sense you think you want.

---

### The recursive hell of references

You already know the candidate. Are you going to get references for your references?

---

## Nervous candidates that undersell

See [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect).

---

## Why employment gaps shouldn't matter

Employment gaps often indicate personal development. Many people use employment as an avoidance strategy and end up being emotionally stunted.

---

## Linkedin is dead but doesn't deserve a funeral

Like Facebook it will soon be a boomer wasteland.

---

## Experience vs. ability to learn

Oftentiems the better candidate may not have all the skills you want right now, but in the long term it's better to have someone who is constantly learning than someone who believes they know enough.

---

## A better approach to personality matrixes

It's not quantization that's at fault, it's the lack of psychological acumen in the first place.

---

Corporate culture, like any other culture, is defined by the people who participate in it - those who *embody it*. Startups can throw around words like "collaboration", "autonomy", and "respect" as much as they like, but typically the companies that have the healthiest culture *define it the least*.

Why? Because they're too busy embodying it. Moral posturing is on it's way out - increasingly these postures are the mark of a business with no product, no future.

What does this have to do with recruiting? Hiring decisions are the most important decisions.

---

Candidates read about "cultures of respect" on your website only to be initiated by being jerked around for a month by a recruiter. Once hired, they've been taught what the culture really is - dicking each other around and getting away with it.

---

### Why everyone hates recruiters

Because they're speedboat-salesmen-wannabe-secret-police masquerading as humanists.

---

People get into recruiting because they love the imbalance of power, but they never use it as the tool that it is. The power dynamic can be useful in discovering who someone is - they do their dance, try this or that, and eventually reveal themselves. Most recruiters are too caught up in the power trip to accomplish anything useful to anyone but themselves.

---

### Recruiters need self knowledge

Because too often their own transferences and resonances with a candidate make them like or dislike them for reasons totally unrelated to the question "Will this candidate *do the job?*". Unless you are familiar with yourself, your motivations, your feelings and past, you are unqualified to make an analytical and intuitive interpretation of a stranger based on a 30 minute video call.

---

Often when recruiters ask about challenges and conflicts at previous workplaces, it seems to preemptively blame the candidate for the situation and saddle them with its resolution. When attempting to learn about the negative aspects of work history, it's better to frame it as an opportunity to learn about what that person finds unacceptable.

Experienced personnel are often very opinionated about professionalism, and the clear expression of dislikes should not be discouraged under the guise of "playing nice".

---

Recruiters make the mistake of forging ahead through every interview as if they're identical, and not changing their course of questioning depending on the answer of the applicant and the overall tone of the interview. In other words, without anything receptive or unexpected you're never going to draw the best out of desireable applicants, nor draw the worst out of the applicants you don't want.

---

Anyone can come up with a limited script of questions to fire out robotically at a candidate. However, plowing through regardless of response and emotional tone creates no rapport and nothing is learned.

A recruiter has to be receptive, monitor their own feelings, and forego expectations in order to encourage novelty and actual communication. They need to learn to bring out the best in a desireable applicant, and bring out the worst in those who should not proceed.

---

Never skip reviewing materials provided by the candidate before the preliminary interview - resume, cover letter, website, work samples. Not only does this disrespect the effort represented by these items, but it wastes their time by forcing them to tell you what you should already know. Anyone worth hiring hates wasting their time.

---

Having a job history isn't about having a perfect past, it's about having a diverse past and learning from it.

---

Candidates should be explicitly asked to tell the whole truth, which won't work unless you've established that you're someone they can trust. That requires demonstrating the willingness to take the risk of telling the truth.
