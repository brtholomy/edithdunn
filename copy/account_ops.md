To the Decorilla hiring team:

I've been working for the last year at a business consultancy for interiors designers - this opportunity has been unique in the regard that our firm is a test case for Houzz Pro, and we work closely with them to improve their workflow and backend integrations. I have strong problem solving ability, and the foresight to see points of friction before they happen. I'm trained in the unforgiving realm of fintech, meaning minor thoughtlessness can cause big issues.

I'd love to bring my familiarity with the interior design space, along with a diligence to the details, and ability to learn anything.

I won't say my favorite color is purple, but I will say that my color sense is unsurpassed. :)

Hire me and I will make you more effective, articulate, and freer to focus on the essentials.

I have prior experience at MIT, in their patent and finance division: I can say from first hand experience, that the lack of digitization even at MIT is ridiculous. Stellic's mission sounds interesting.

Previously I was a workshop designer for a startup consultancy in NYC, but most recently I've moved into a client manager role at a consultancy for interior designers in LA. My primary responsibility is to maintain our customer's trust and remove obstacles to their success, all while continuously debugging at least 3 software integrations and tracking the financial data that flows between them - essentially "lowcode" fintech.
