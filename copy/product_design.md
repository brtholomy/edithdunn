## HR startup

I've been designing apps, web portals, print material and events for nearly 6 years. My experience designing and running corporate culture workshops in the NYC startup scene is especially relevant. More recently I've been working with an interior design consultancy in LA: we remove the obstacles to their success by creating an attractive set of tools and workflows. Let me show you what I can do for Shift.

# inhouse design firm

I've been a brand designer, technical illustrator for academic science, screenprint and sublimation designer for an in-house fashion firm in NYC, and most recently I've moved into a manager role at a consultancy for interior designers in LA. I live and breathe design, but I have the project management skills to lead a team and meet long-term goals: much of my job right now is managing the flow of a vast sea of details between our high-profile clients and our internal teams. I notice mistakes where others don't and I have a superb memory. I write excellent emails that explain complex technical subjects to creative people. I love to make my clients feel empowered, while gently untangling the messy reality of their business so we can focus on the fun parts. Let me show you how we can make Catalog stand out.

# what interests you about this company?

First of all, I love your aesthetic: fresh and bold color blocking is in. I've been designing branding suites and illustration packages for startups, academics, and interior designers for the last 6 years. My experience designing technical illustrations for a neuroscientist is especially relevant: I had to learn something about topology and nonlinear complex systems along the way.

I use Midjourney often to explore ideas: I appreciate the similarity to a commandline interface and the relative freedom of its parameter syntax.

I've been designing branding suites and illustration packages for startups, psychologists, academics, and designers for the last 6 years. My experience designing illustrations for a meditation teacher is especially relevant: it's not easy to convey that kind of information at a glance.
