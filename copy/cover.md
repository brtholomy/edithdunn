Every detail is an opportunity, every word and image is a potential resonance for your customers: I have that analytical determination a project manager needs, combined with the relentless creativity to find hidden solutions.

Recently I've been working with interior designers in LA, generating UX/product design in cooperation with the leading software solution in the industry. In years prior, I served as product and workshop designer at a corporate culture consultancy in NYC, and as creative director and illustrator for a neuroscience research consultant. Let me demonstrate what my passion and diligence can do for you.

I notice mistakes where others don't and I have a superb memory. I write excellent emails that explain complex technical concepts to creative people. I have years of experience helping dreamers realize their vision in the gritty details.

Let's build something important together.
