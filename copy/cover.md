Every detail is an opportunity, every word and image is a potential resonance for your customers: I have that analytical determination a project manager needs, combined with the relentless creativity to find hidden solutions.

The last few years of working with interior designers, a neuroscience researcher, and a corporate culture consultancy have broadened my skillset. Let me demonstrate what my passion and diligence can do for you.

I notice mistakes where others don't and I have a superb memory. I write excellent emails that explain complex technical concepts to creative people. I have years of experience helping dreamers realize their vision in the practical gritty details.

Let's build something important together.
