Achievements

In my last position, the manager who was supposed to train me was fired almost immediately after I joined: within a month, I had taught myself the interior design business such that I was promoted to client manager and started managing my own team. I now provide financial consultation for accounts in the millions of dollars in a high-pressure market.

I've developed my own recruiting process by examining unconscious communication, accessible via associative techniques developed in collaboration with an NYC psychoanalyst and neuroscientist.

I'm an experienced illustrator and UX designer: much of my current role revolves around refining the customer experience for creative types who dislike complex software.
