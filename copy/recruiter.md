For years now, I've been been working with high-profile talent in extremely competitive industries: NYC fashion, LA interior design, and Silicon Valley neuroscience among others. I thrive in challenging roles with high growth potential. I've got the psychological chops and experience to craft an excellent team that can endure the pressures of the startup pace.

I'm passionate about recruiting. Previously I was a workshop designer for a startup consultancy in NYC, and I've seen the bad and the good. Over the years I've developed my own unique process designed to capture that elusive metric: how will this candidate perform over the long term, when no one is looking, when it really matters? The usual solution is to consult past performance: but this can be easily obscured, and in the case of new graduates is an almost meaningless question. My answer depends on examining unconscious communication, accessible via associative techniques developed in collaboration with an NYC psychoanalyst and neuroscientist.

I'm uniquely qualified for this role because I'm both an experienced recruiter and a financial analyst in my current role. As a financial consultant for interior designers, I'm constantly battling integration errors between our meticulous processes and some old buggy industry software we can't control. Nearly half of our expenses - and half of why I have to do so much recruiting - would disappear if these integrations were reliable or weren't necessary.

I want to build out a people platform from scratch: I've got the psychological chops and experience to craft an excellent team that can endure the pressures of the startup pace.
